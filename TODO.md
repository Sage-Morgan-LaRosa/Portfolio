# TODO: Edit Animated Line Bend

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Edit Home.html: Update the SVG path d attribute to increase the section between bends so the line goes lower (change to "M0 10 L4 10 L6 18 L18 20")
- [x] Edit Home.html: Reduce stroke-width to 0.5 for a more digital look
- [x] Edit Home-styles.css: Adjust stroke-dasharray to match the new path length (approx 24)
- [ ] Add blink effect to the line after the dash animation completes, and stop when scrolling out
- [ ] Test the animation by opening Home.html in a browser and scrolling to the project area to verify the changes
